# IBU-calculator-sheet
excel sheet for IBU calculations

HOW TO USE: "Variety" is just for show and your own reference, it does not pull any specs on hops. Required inputs are Final volume, OG, Amount, AA%, Duration, and Temperature. This sheet uses metric units to calculate IBU, conversion calculators are provided for the yanks ;)

I originally made it for estimating IBUs in RAW ales, and each step is compounded, taking IBU potential in to account. 

This sheet can also be used to estimate total IBUs from kettle additions that are left in for the whirlpool/hopstand. Just use step 1 as the boil duration and set temperature to 100, and use subsequent steps for whirlpool/hopstand durations and temperatures.
